# RECALL Roadmap

> Last updated: April 2026
> Current version: **1.1.0**

---

## Design Law

RECALL is a structured publishing language. Three concerns are always kept separate:

| Concern | Mechanism | Changes via |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Core elements (verbs) | Compiler release |
| Visual | Theme layer (palette, fonts, style-block) | `.rcpy` copybook |
| Reuse | Component library | `.rcpy` files / npm |

This separation is the invariant. New releases add elements or capabilities — they
never break the contract between layers.

---

## v0.8.8 — Compiler Hardening + Framework Documents ✅ Complete

### Parser error recovery

The parser no longer aborts on first error. Every construct the parser cannot
handle emits a warning, applies a safe default, and continues. A malformed program
now produces a complete diagnostic report in one pass.

**RCL-W07** — unknown PIC type (defaults to PIC X, warns)
**RCL-W08** — malformed VALUE clause (treats as empty, warns)

`ParseWarning` channel keeps the parser pure. Warnings drain into the
DiagnosticCollector during type-checking.

### Per-code diagnostic test coverage

22 dedicated tests — one per diagnostic code. Each test: minimal `.rcl` fixture
that triggers exactly that code, assertion on exact code in `check()` output.
9 test files, 99 tests total.

`CheckResult.warningMessages` — warning messages now exposed as a structured
string array in the `check()` API, matching the shape of `errors`.

**RCL-W01 fix** — ITEMS SECTION top-level `01` entries are now structurally
`isGroup: true` regardless of child count. The dead code path in the typechecker
is now reachable.

### Formal grammar specification

`docs/RECALL-GRAMMAR.md` — full EBNF grammar for the RECALL language. Normative
reference: the compiler implements this document, not the other way around. Covers
all five divisions, lexical conventions, built-in elements table, error recovery
section, language invariants, and complete diagnostic reference.

### Framework documents

`docs/COGNITIVE-DIMENSIONS-ANALYSIS.md` — analytical evaluation of RECALL v0.8.8
against all 13 dimensions of the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework
(Green & Petre, 1996).

`docs/MACHINE-LEGIBILITY-FRAMEWORK.md` — Machine Legibility Dimensions (MLD),
v0.1 proposed framework. Nine dimensions for evaluating notations where the
primary reader is an AI system. RECALL used as reference implementation.
Companion to Cognitive Dimensions, not a replacement.

`CITATION.cff` — machine-readable citation metadata. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.19463347.

---

## v0.8.9 — recall scaffold ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Generate a working `.rcl` file from a plugin component manifest.
Eliminates the blank-page problem — the author starts from a compilable file,
not empty boilerplate.

### recall scaffold

New CLI command. Reads `components/index.json` from any installed plugin package
and generates a complete `.rcl` pre-populated with correct DATA DIVISION fields,
PIC types, COMMENT annotations, group shapes, and PROCEDURE DIVISION usage.

```sh
# List available components
recall scaffold --list --plugin @semanticintent/recall-ui

# Generate to stdout
recall scaffold PAGE-HERO --plugin @semanticintent/recall-ui

# Generate to file
recall scaffold CARD-SECTION --plugin @semanticintent/recall-ui --out ./my-page.rcl
```

Generated output for `PAGE-HERO`:

```cobol
* Generated by recall scaffold
* Plugin:    @semanticintent/recall-ui
* Component: PAGE-HERO

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
   PROGRAM-ID.   MY-PAGE.
   PAGE-TITLE.   "My Page".
   AUTHOR.       .
   DATE-WRITTEN. 2026-04-08.

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
   COPY FROM "@semanticintent/recall-ui/themes/dark.rcpy".

DATA DIVISION.
   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
      01 HERO-TITLE    PIC X(60)  VALUE "[HERO-TITLE]".
         COMMENT "Main headline — short, declarative"
      01 HERO-SUBTITLE PIC X(200) VALUE "[HERO-SUBTITLE]".
         COMMENT "Supporting paragraph — one or two sentences"
      01 CTA-LABEL     PIC X(30)  VALUE "[CTA-LABEL]".
         COMMENT "Primary call to action button label"
      01 CTA-HREF      PIC URL    VALUE "/path".
         COMMENT "Button destination"
   ITEMS SECTION.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.

   RENDER-MAIN.
      DISPLAY PAGE-HERO
         WITH HERO-TITLE HERO-TITLE
         WITH HERO-SUBTITLE HERO-SUBTITLE
         WITH CTA-LABEL CTA-LABEL
         WITH CTA-HREF CTA-HREF.
   STOP SECTION.

   STOP RUN.
```

### Component manifest — recall-ui

`@semanticintent/recall-ui` ships `components/index.json` — a machine-readable
manifest describing each component's accepts, PIC types, kind (scalar/group),
COMMENT annotations, group-shape definitions, and intent. This is the contract
`recall scaffold` reads. Any plugin can ship a manifest in the same format to
gain scaffold support.

### Architecture note

`src/scaffold/index.ts` contains pure functions only — no side effects, no CLI
coupling. Designed for future extraction to `@semanticintent/recall-tools` when
the tooling layer warrants its own package. The CLI command is a thin wrapper.

---

## v0.8.11 — VALUE HEREDOC + Pipeline Hardening ✅ Complete

### VALUE HEREDOC

New block literal form for truly opaque multi-line content. Unlike `VALUE BLOCK`, which
strips indentation and joins content, `VALUE HEREDOC` treats everything between the
delimiters as raw text — no interpretation, no heuristics.

```cobol
DATA DIVISION.
   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
      01 CODE-EXAMPLE PIC X VALUE HEREDOC.
         IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
            PROGRAM-ID. MY-PAGE.

         DATA DIVISION.
            WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
               01 HERO-TITLE PIC X(60) VALUE "RECALL — the source that remembers".

         PROCEDURE DIVISION.
            RENDER.
               DISPLAY PAGE-HERO WITH DATA HERO-TITLE.
            STOP RUN.
      END HEREDOC.
```

The only closer is the literal string `END HEREDOC.` — it cannot appear accidentally
in content. Quoted strings, division headers, COPY FROM paths — all opaque.

Use `VALUE BLOCK` for prose and multi-paragraph body text.
Use `VALUE HEREDOC` for code examples, JSON fragments, or any content that contains
RECALL syntax or embedded quotes.

### Pipeline reorder

`resolveBlockValues` now runs **first** in the preprocessor pipeline — before
`resolveThemeCopies` and `resolveComponentCopies`. Block and heredoc content is
collapsed to single-line `VALUE "..."` strings before any other preprocessor runs.

**Why this matters:** The downstream preprocessors use a `".` heuristic to detect
the end of multiline VALUE strings. Once a HEREDOC or BLOCK is collapsed, there is
no embedded `".` for the heuristic to misread. The pipeline is now self-consistent —
each stage sees only the literal forms it was designed to handle.

Previous order: theme → component → block → record → data-loads → parse
New order: **block → theme → component → record → data-loads → parse**

---

## v0.9.0 — DATA COPY ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Shared field definitions across pages. Same `COPY FROM` keyword used in
ENVIRONMENT and COMPONENT divisions — applied to DATA DIVISION for the first time.

### What it ships

**DATA COPY** — `COPY FROM` in DATA DIVISION inlines field definitions from `.rcpy`
copybooks at compile time. Shared fields are author-declared, fully typed, and
visible to the type checker, the AI compositor (`recall check --format json`), and
the `recall schema` output.

```cobol
DATA DIVISION.
   COPY FROM "shared/nav-fields.rcpy".
   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
      01 PAGE-TITLE PIC X(60) VALUE "Home".
```

A data copybook is a `.rcpy` file with a DATA DIVISION:

```cobol
DATA DIVISION.
   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
      01 NAV-TITLE PIC X(40) VALUE "RECALL".
      01 NAV-HREF  PIC URL   VALUE "/".
   ITEMS SECTION.
      01 NAV-ITEMS.
         05 NAV-ITEMS-1.
            10 NAV-ITEMS-1-LABEL PIC X(30) VALUE "Home".
            10 NAV-ITEMS-1-HREF  PIC URL   VALUE "/".
```

Nested COPY chains are resolved recursively. Circular dependencies are detected.
Field name collisions between copybook and local declarations are errors.

### New Diagnostic Codes

| Code | Severity | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| RCL-024 | error | DATA COPY file not found or unresolvable npm path |
| RCL-025 | error | Field name collision — copybook field collides with local or prior field |
| RCL-026 | error | Circular DATA COPY dependency |

### Pipeline position

`resolveDataCopies` runs after component copy resolution and before record expansion:

```
resolveBlockValues → resolveThemeCopies → resolveComponentCopies
→ resolveDataCopies   ← NEW
→ resolveRecordTypes → resolveDataLoads → parse
```

### `runPreprocessorPipeline()` helper

The preprocessor pipeline was previously duplicated across four call sites
(`compile`, `check`, `inspect`, `parseFromSource`). Extracted into a single
`runPreprocessorPipeline()` function — new stages are added once, not four times.

---

## v1.0.0 — WITH INTENT ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Implement the AI-first thesis. The language now has a formally constrained
mechanism for AI-driven composition — structured, compiler-validated, human-reviewable.

### What it ships

**`WITH INTENT`** — annotates a DISPLAY statement with natural language intent:

```cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   RENDER.
      DISPLAY HERO
         WITH INTENT "dramatic opening, single product, urgency without hype"
         WITH DATA PRODUCT-NAME, PRODUCT-TAGLINE, CTA-PRIMARY.
   STOP RUN.
```

Before expansion: compiles with an HTML placeholder comment (RCL-W09 warning).
After `recall expand`: a `.expanded.rcl` file replaces the WITH INTENT with
concrete DISPLAY statements. Author reviews, renames, commits.

**`recall expand`** — new CLI command:
```sh
recall expand page.rcl              # calls compositor, writes page.expanded.rcl
recall expand page.rcl --dry-run    # print compositor payload, no API call
recall expand page.rcl --out ./out  # write to a specific directory
```

**Compositor contract** (`docs/COMPOSITOR-CONTRACT.md`) — normative specification
for the JSON payload and expected response. Versioned at `schemaVersion: "1.0"`.

### New Diagnostic Codes

| Code | Severity | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| RCL-W09 | warning | Unexpanded WITH INTENT clause — renders as placeholder |
| RCL-027 | error | Expansion failed — compositor returned invalid RECALL |

### Implementation

- `DisplayStatement.intent` — optional field in parser AST
- `checkUnexpandedIntents()` — typechecker pass emitting RCL-W09
- RCL-003 skip guard — `WITH INTENT` statements exempt from unknown-element check
- `renderStatementWithRegistry()` — placeholder comment path in generator
- `src/expand/index.ts` — pure `expand()` function (no CLI coupling)
- `src/expand/prompt.ts` — compositor system prompt (iterable independently)
- `src/cli/commands/expand.ts` — thin CLI wrapper

### What 1.0 means

- Core element vocabulary complete and stable
- Breaking changes require a major version
- The AI-first thesis is implemented, not just documented
- 124 tests covering all 29 diagnostic codes

---

## v1.0 (archived planning) — Stable Language

**Goal:** Language specification frozen. Compiler is a stable runtime. All diagnostic
codes fire. The AI-first thesis is implemented, not just documented.

### Prerequisites (all met)

- ✅ All diagnostic codes actively enforced
- ✅ LAYOUT SPLIT structural validation (RCL-008)
- ✅ Palette key period error (RCL-022)
- ✅ Parser error recovery — never abort on first error
- ✅ Per-code test coverage — 22 codes, 99 tests
- ✅ Formal EBNF grammar specification
- ✅ `@semanticintent/recall-ui` standard component library published

### What 1.0 ships

**`WITH INTENT`** — the AI composition primitive. A formally constrained clause
that an AI compositor expands into valid RECALL source within the language's own
grammar. The implementation of the AI-first thesis.

```cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.

   RENDER.
      DISPLAY HERO
         WITH INTENT "dramatic opening, single product, urgency without hype"
         WITH DATA PRODUCT-NAME, PRODUCT-TAGLINE, CTA-PRIMARY.

   STOP RUN.
```

The compositor receives: live schema JSON, DATA DIVISION symbols, ENVIRONMENT
palette, COMPONENT registry, intent string, layout token. It produces valid
RECALL PROCEDURE statements. The compiler validates output — same pipeline as
any RECALL source.

```
recall expand <file>   reads WITH INTENT clauses, calls compositor,
                       writes expanded source alongside original
```

**Site manifest** — a `site.rcl` that declares what pages exist, what data they
share, and what navigation links between them. Makes RECALL viable for a full
publishing site, not just single pages.

```cobol
SITE DIVISION.
   SITE-ID.    SEMANTICINTENT.
   BASE-URL.   "https://semanticintent.dev".

   PAGES SECTION.
      PAGE landing.rcl    AT "/".
      PAGE writing.rcl    AT "/writing".
      PAGE ecosystem.rcl  AT "/ecosystem".

   SHARED DATA SECTION.
      COPY FROM "shared/nav-items.rcpy".
      COPY FROM "shared/footer-fields.rcpy".
```

**DATA COPY** — shared field definitions across pages with one authoritative
source, circular dependency detection, and duplicate field errors. The copybook
lesson applied correctly before the feature ships.

**What 1.0 means for RECALL:**
- Core element vocabulary complete and stable
- Theme layer (palette / font / style-block) is the documented extension point
- Component libraries are the unit of community contribution
- Breaking changes require a major version
- Silent failures are errors, everywhere

---

## v1.1.0 — Provenance, Semantic Diff, and Editor Support ✅ Complete

**Theme:** The source that remembers who wrote it.

### recall diff — Semantic AST Diff

AST-level diff between two `.rcl` sources — not a text diff. Reports field renames,
PIC type changes, value changes, added/removed DISPLAY statements, IDENTIFICATION
changes. Supports two-file and git revision syntax.

```sh
recall diff v1.rcl v2.rcl
recall diff HEAD~1 HEAD page.rcl
recall diff HEAD~1 HEAD page.rcl --suggest-audit   # ready-made CHANGE-LOG entry
recall diff --format json v1.rcl v2.rcl
```

### AUDIT DIVISION

Formal provenance as a language construct. Sixth optional division, declared after
PROCEDURE DIVISION. CREATED-BY is constrained to exactly three values: `Human`,
`AI compositor`, `AI agent` — anything else is RCL-030 (compile error).

```cobol
AUDIT DIVISION.
   CREATED-BY.   Human.
   CREATED-DATE. 2026-04-11.
   CHANGE-LOG.
      2026-04-11 "Human"         "Initial authoring.".
      2026-04-11 "AI compositor" "Expanded WITH INTENT block.".
```

Compiles into a structured HTML comment in every artifact. New diagnostic codes:
RCL-028 (bad CREATED-DATE), RCL-029 (change entry before CREATED-DATE), RCL-030
(invalid author kind), RCL-W11 (empty CHANGE-LOG).

### LSP — `@semanticintent/recall-lsp@0.1.0`

Full Language Server Protocol implementation. Diagnostics, autocomplete, hover,
go-to-definition, rename. stdio/IPC transport — works with VS Code, Cursor, Neovim,
JetBrains. Copilot and Cursor consume LSP data, making RECALL field types and
diagnostic codes visible to AI coding assistants.

`recall-vscode` extension built on top — TextMate grammar, LSP client. VS Code
Marketplace publish deferred.

### recall stats — Pipeline Telemetry Mode

`recall stats` with no file argument reads `index.json` and aggregates compile_ms,
coverage_pct, truncations, and human_touches across all compiled cases.

### Playground WITH INTENT Expand ✅ Live

`recall-compiler-api` Worker ships `POST /expand` — parses the source, walks WITH
INTENT statements, calls Workers AI (Llama 3.3 70B fp8-fast) with a structured
payload, caches results in KV (7-day TTL), rewrites source, returns expanded `.rcl`.
Playground wires an Expand ✦ button (shown only when WITH INTENT is present) that
calls the endpoint and re-compiles the expanded source live. Reset button restores
the original.

### DOI

`semanticintent/recall-compiler` — DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.19463347`

Covers the compiler architecture, MLD framework, EMBER/RECALL relationship, and
formal grammar. Update candidates for v1.2: AUDIT DIVISION spec, recall diff schema,
LSP architecture.

---

## v1.2.0 — Dev Server + Artifact Validation ✅ Complete

**Theme:** The source that proves itself.

### `recall serve` — Dev Server with Hot Reload

File-watching dev server that compiles `.rcl` on save and reloads every connected
browser tab via Server-Sent Events. Zero runtime dependencies — built on Node.js
built-in `http` and `fs.watch`.

```sh
recall serve page.rcl              # single file, default port 4321
recall serve page.rcl --port 8080
recall serve src/                  # directory mode — all .rcl files + index
recall serve src/ --port 3000
```

- **Single-file mode:** serves `GET /` and `GET /page.html`
- **Directory mode:** serves `GET /` as a live index of all pages
- **Hot reload:** SSE endpoint at `/__recall_events`; injected client script calls `location.reload()` on message
- **Copybook changes:** `.rcpy` file changes trigger recompile of all `.rcl` in the same directory
- **Debounce:** 250ms — editor-save bursts don't trigger multiple recompiles

The compiler remains a pure function. `recall serve` is a thin wrapper.

### `recall validate` — Artifact Self-Validation

Extracts the embedded `.rcl` source from a compiled HTML artifact, recompiles it,
and verifies the output matches the live file. The "source is the artifact" principle
taken to its logical conclusion.

```sh
recall validate page.html                  # verify a local compiled artifact
recall validate https://example.com        # verify a live URL
recall validate page.html --format json    # CI-friendly JSON output
recall validate page.html --quiet          # exit code only (0=valid, 1=invalid)
```

**Validation path:**

1. If the `.rcl` source file exists alongside the `.html` — use `recall compile` for
   accurate COPY FROM / LOAD FROM resolution.
2. If only the `.html` exists (or a URL) — extract embedded source, use
   `compileFromSource` in-memory. Files using COPY FROM / LOAD FROM may report
   VALID-001 in this mode; validate locally with the `.rcl` alongside for a
   definitive result.

**Diagnostic codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VALID-001` | Output mismatch — HTML body does not match embedded source |
| `VALID-002` | No embedded source — file was not compiled by `recall compile` |
| `VALID-003` | Recompile failed — embedded source has errors |

**What it catches:** Any direct edit to the compiled HTML after compilation — modified
heading text, injected content, altered links. The embedded source comment is the
authoritative record; any divergence between it and the body is a VALID-001.

---

## Post-1.2 — Language Maturity

Features that extend the philosophy without changing the foundation.

---

### Output Targets

**Goal:** One source, multiple artifacts. The DATA DIVISION and element vocabulary
stay constant. The ENVIRONMENT DIVISION declares the output target. The generator
changes; the author's contract does not.

```cobol
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
   CONFIGURATION SECTION.
      TARGET EMAIL.       ← or PDF, RSS, HTML (default)
```

**Why it extends the philosophy:** The "source is the artifact" principle deepens
when the same source produces multiple artifact formats. A DATA DIVISION declared
once can compile to a web page, a PDF report, and an email digest. The AI
compositor's contract — the data types, the COMMENT clauses, the WITH INTENT
clauses — applies identically across all targets.

**Planned targets:** HTML (current), PDF, email (HTML-email subset), RSS feed.

---

### LSP — Language Server Protocol

**Goal:** RECALL becomes a real language in every editor — VS Code, Neovim,
JetBrains, any LSP-capable editor.

**What it provides:**
- Autocomplete on element names, PIC types, clause modifiers
- Hover to see PIC type, VALUE, and COMMENT clause for any field reference
- Inline diagnostic codes as you type — no compile step required
- Go-to-definition from PROCEDURE DIVISION reference to DATA DIVISION declaration
- Rename refactoring — rename a field, all references update

**Why the foundation is already there:** The formal grammar (`RECALL-GRAMMAR.md`),
the symbol table, and the diagnostic system are the hard parts of an LSP. The
protocol layer is the surface. The compiler's `check()` function already does
everything an LSP needs — it just needs a server wrapper and an incremental
parsing layer.

**Why it matters for the AI-first thesis:** An LSP makes the live schema and
symbol table visible in the editor — the same data that `recall schema --json`
and `recall check --format json` expose to AI compositors. Human authors and AI
compositors see the same contract, in the same place.

---

### `recall diff` — Semantic Diff

**Goal:** A diff that understands RECALL structure, not just text. The provenance
model taken seriously as a tool.

```
recall diff v1.rcl v2.rcl
```

```
CHANGED  HERO-HEADING: "STILL HERE." → "BUILT FOR THE AI ERA."
ADDED    HERO-BADGE    PIC X(20) VALUE "NEW"
REMOVED  RENDER-INSTALL section (3 statements)
CHANGED  CARD-LIST USING WHY-COBOL-ITEMS — WITH COLUMNS 3 → WITH COLUMNS 2
```

**Why it extends the philosophy:** A text diff on a `.rcl` file tells you what
characters changed. A semantic diff tells you what *the page* changed — which
fields, which sections, which layout decisions. For a publishing language where
the source is the artifact and provenance matters, this is the audit tool the
philosophy implies.

**Integration point:** `recall history` (v0.8) already shows DATA field diffs
between git commits. `recall diff` extends this to full structural comparison
between any two sources.

---

### AUDIT DIVISION

**Goal:** Formal provenance tracking as a language-level construct. A division
that records who changed what, when, and with what intent — and travels with
every compiled output.

```cobol
AUDIT DIVISION.
   CREATED-BY.    Michael Shatny.
   CREATED-DATE.  2026-04-07.
   CHANGE-LOG.
      2026-04-07  HERO-HEADING updated. Human. "Sharpened the opening line."
      2026-04-08  RENDER-WHY expanded. AI compositor. "Added third card per WITH INTENT."
```

**Why it extends the philosophy:** When human and AI authorship interleave over
time, the compiled HTML currently embeds the *current* source but not the history
of how it got there. The AUDIT DIVISION makes change provenance a formal language
construct — not a git log annotation, not a comment, but a structured division
with typed entries that compile into the artifact.

For long-lived documents maintained by human-AI pairs — reports, documentation
sites, case studies — this is the missing layer. No other publishing language
has it. It is the direct completion of the "source is the artifact" principle:
not just what the source is, but how it became that.

---

### Common Record Description ✅ Complete — v1.0.6

**Status:** Implemented. See `docs/COMMON-RECORD-DESCRIPTION.md`.

The **Common Record Description** is the agreed field set across three pipeline layers:
MCP `inputSchema` (author-facing) → brief JSON (storage) → RECALL DATA DIVISION
(compiler-facing). All three express the same contract in different syntaxes for
different audiences.

Distinct from — and must not be conflated with:

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Language Schema** | `recall schema` — valid RECALL elements, PIC types, divisions |
| **Component Manifest** | `components/index.json` — plugin field definitions for `recall scaffold` |
| **Common Record Description** | `inputSchema` + brief JSON + DATA DIVISION — field agreement for a publishing use case |

**Shipped as `recall crd`** — validates that a brief JSON and a DATA DIVISION are
consistent with each other. Catches field name mismatches, PIC X length violations
that would truncate silently, and group cardinality mismatches before the compile
step runs. Four diagnostic codes: CRD-001 through CRD-004. Output modes: text
(default), `--format json`, `--strict`, `--quiet`.

---

### Pipeline Manifest ✅ Complete — v1.0.7

**Shipped as `recall manifest`** — assembles all four pipeline schema layers
(Language Schema, Component Manifest, Common Record Description, Compositor
Contract) into one machine-readable payload. The language schema is always inlined.
Component names populate when `--plugin <package>` is given. Supports `--layer`
for single-layer output and `--json` for AI consumption.

---

**Original goal:** A single machine-readable + human-readable declaration that unites all
four schema layers into one document an AI orchestrator can read before touching
anything in the pipeline.

**The problem it solves:** Right now an AI agent must know to read four separate
documents — Language Schema, Component Manifest, Common Record Description, and
Compositor Contract — in the right order, to understand the full pipeline. That
coordination cost lands on the prompt or SKILL file. A Pipeline Manifest makes
the answer to "what are the rules here?" a single read.

**Command:**

```sh
recall manifest              # human-readable summary
recall manifest --json       # machine-readable JSON for AI consumption
recall manifest --layer crd  # single layer only
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "schema": "recall-manifest/1.0",
  "philosophy": "Structured publishing language. Source is the artifact. AI authors, compiler renders, human reviews.",
  "layers": {
    "language": {
      "command": "recall schema --json",
      "purpose": "All valid RECALL elements, PIC types, divisions, and clauses"
    },
    "components": {
      "manifest": "@stratiqx/recall-components/components/index.json",
      "purpose": "Field definitions and group shapes for available plugin components"

```

**Why it completes the architecture:** An orchestrating agent — whether Claude
Desktop, an autonomous cluster pipeline, or a future agent in a new environment —
needs one document that carries the institutional knowledge of the pipeline.
The manifest is that document. It travels with the pipeline regardless of context,
model, or tool.

**Grace Hopper's name for it (1959):** Program Library Directory — the catalogue
of what exists and what contract each entry honours.

### Performance Measurement & Compiler Telemetry

**Goal:** Make compiler and render performance observable — per-compile metrics
embedded in the output, and a per-case track record that accumulates over time.

**Why it matters:** As the pipeline moves toward autonomous operation (model →
brief → RECALL → deploy with no human in the middle), the quality signal shifts
from subjective review to measurable output characteristics. Human touches per
published case is the north star metric; the telemetry below feeds it.

#### Compile-time metrics (per run)

Captured automatically during `generate()` and written to brief JSON and/or
`index.json` on every non-preview compile:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `compile_ms` | Total time from `parseFromSource()` to HTML string (ms) |
| `output_chars` | Character count of the final HTML |
| `fields_populated` | Count of DATA DIVISION fields with non-empty VALUES |
| `fields_total` | Total schema fields declared |
| `coverage_pct` | `fields_populated / fields_total × 100` — brief completeness proxy |
| `truncations` | Count of fields where value was truncated to PIC X(n) limit |

`truncations > 0` currently a silent failure — this surfaces it.

#### Per-case track record

`index.json` entries gain a `meta` block alongside the existing scores:

```json
{
  "num": "230",
  "fetch": 3610,
  "meta": {
    "compile_ms": 142,
    "output_chars": 81311,
    "coverage_pct": 94,
    "truncations": 0,
    "human_touches": 1
  }
}
```

`human_touches` — manually incremented when a post-compile fix is applied
(footer patch, citation revision, etc.). Tracks pipeline maturity over time.
Target: zero for cases published after the pipeline stabilises.

#### Comparative baseline

At the time of writing (April 2026, v1.0.5), reference points from the
case study pipeline:

| Case | Output chars | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UC-229 | — | Pre-telemetry baseline |
| UC-230 | 81,311 | First case with DIM-TAG + citations |

**Implementation note:** Metrics are captured in `generate-case-html.ts` in
`semantic-cal-workflow-mcp` — not in the compiler itself. The compiler is a
pure function; telemetry lives in the tool layer that calls it. This keeps
the compiler's contract clean.

## Design Observations — Carried Forward to 1.0

### 1. `USING` vs `WITH DATA` — two binding mechanisms

- `DISPLAY NAVIGATION USING NAV-ITEMS` — group reference for built-in elements
- `DISPLAY MY-COMP WITH DATA FIELD1, FIELD2` — DATA DIVISION binding for components

Surface area is small but real. 1.0 should document the decision rule clearly or
consider unifying.

### 2. PIC X(n) premature commitment

Authors must estimate field length before writing the value. An `AUTOLEN` modifier
that opts a field out of length validation is under consideration for 1.0 — for
body text and long-form fields where length enforcement adds friction without
semantic value.

### 3. Progressive evaluation gap

RECALL requires a complete program structure to compile. A `--draft` mode that
compiles with missing or empty fields using placeholder content would make early
authoring faster without changing the language. Planned post-1.1.

---

## Post-1.1 — Next Level

The items below were identified after v1.1.0 shipped. Each extends the core
philosophy without changing the language contract.

---

### `recall validate` — The Artifact Validates Itself

**Goal:** Every compiled RECALL HTML embeds its own `.rcl` source in a comment.
`recall validate page.html` extracts that source, recompiles it, and verifies the
output matches the live file. A deployed page that can prove it was not tampered with
after compilation.

```sh
recall validate page.html           # recompile embedded source, diff against file
recall validate https://example.com/page.html  # validate a live URL
```

**Why it's next level:** "Source is the artifact" taken to its logical conclusion.
No other publishing language has this. Also opens a CI gate: validate the deployed
HTML directly, not the source.

**New diagnostic codes:** VALID-001 (source/output mismatch), VALID-002 (no
embedded source found).

---

### `recall serve` — Dev Server

**Goal:** A file-watching dev server that recompiles `.rcl` on save and hot-reloads
the browser. Not a runtime — a dev loop.

```sh
recall serve src/              # watch all .rcl, serve compiled HTML on localhost:4321
recall serve index.rcl         # single file
recall serve src/ --port 8080
```

**Why it matters:** The current authoring loop is compile → open file → refresh.
`recall serve` collapses that to save → see. The single biggest friction in day-to-day
authoring. Compiler remains a pure function — the server is a thin wrapper.

---

### `recall import` — Convert HTML or Markdown to RECALL

**Goal:** Take an existing HTML page or Markdown file and produce a compilable `.rcl`.
AI-assisted extraction: prose becomes DATA DIVISION fields, headings become PIC X
fields, structured content maps to ITEMS groups.

```sh
recall import page.html --out page.rcl
recall import README.md --out page.rcl
recall import https://example.com --out page.rcl
```

**Why it matters:** The single biggest adoption barrier is "I have an existing page,
where do I start?" `recall import` answers it. Output is annotated with COMMENT
clauses from the AI extraction pass — the imported source is immediately legible.

---

### `recall test` — Content Assertions

**Goal:** A test layer above the type checker. Author-declared content quality rules
that run at compile time (or as a separate `recall test` pass).

```cobol
TEST DIVISION.
   ASSERT HERO-HEADING LENGTH BETWEEN 10 AND 60.
   ASSERT CTA-LABEL NOT CONTAINS "click here".
   ASSERT all PIC URL RESOLVES.
   ASSERT AUDIT DIVISION PRESENT.
```

```sh
recall test page.rcl           # run assertions, exit 1 on failure
recall test page.rcl --format json
```

**Why it extends the philosophy:** The type checker enforces structural validity.
TEST DIVISION enforces content quality. Together: if it compiles and passes tests, it
is both valid and meets the author's stated standard. CI-friendly. New division,
new diagnostic namespace (RCL-T01...).

---

### Semantic Versioning of Content

**Goal:** Extend AUDIT DIVISION with a `VERSION.` field in IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
`recall diff --semver` analyses the diff and suggests a semantic version bump:

- **patch** — value changes only (copy edits)
- **minor** — fields added, no removals
- **major** — fields removed, PIC type changes, structural changes

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
   PROGRAM-ID.   MY-SITE.
   VERSION.      1.2.0.
```

```sh
recall diff HEAD~1 HEAD page.rcl --semver
# → SUGGESTED BUMP: minor (2 fields added, 0 removed)
```

**Why it matters:** Page content gets the same versioning discipline as software
packages. Pairs with AUDIT DIVISION — the version tells you what changed, the AUDIT
DIVISION tells you who changed it.

---

### GitHub Action — `semanticintent/recall-action`

**Goal:** Official CI integration as a published GitHub Action.

```yaml
- uses: semanticintent/recall-action@v1
  with:
    check: strict
    validate-audit: true
    post-diagnostics: true    # post compile diagnostics as PR comment
```

Runs `recall check --strict` on every push. Optionally posts compile telemetry as PR
comments. Validates AUDIT DIVISION presence and date consistency against git history.

**Why it matters:** This is how a language becomes a serious professional tool — not
through features but through integration. The same path ESLint and Prettier took.

---

### Formal Language Standard

**Goal:** Position RECALL as a published specification, not just a compiler project.
The DOI (`10.5281/zenodo.19463347`) already archives the compiler. The next step is
a separate formal spec document — `RECALL-SPEC.md` / `RECALL-SPEC-1.1.pdf` — that
any implementation could conform to.

**What the spec covers:**
- Full EBNF grammar (already in `RECALL-GRAMMAR.md` — promote to normative)
- Division semantics and ordering rules
- PIC type system and validation rules
- AUDIT DIVISION author-kind constraint
- Diagnostic code registry (stable identifiers, not implementation details)
- Compositor Contract (WITH INTENT expansion protocol)

**Update candidates for current DOI (v1.2 Zenodo version):**
- AUDIT DIVISION specification
- `recall diff` schema (`recall-diff/1.0`)
- LSP architecture and capability surface
- v1.1.0 diagnostic additions (RCL-028/029/030/W11)

**Why it matters:** A spec document separates the language from the implementation.
Other tools (AI agents, alternative compilers, validators) can conform to RECALL
without depending on `@semanticintent/recall-compiler`. This is how a language
outlives its first implementation.

---

### `AUTOLEN` Modifier

**Goal:** Opt a field out of `PIC X(n)` length enforcement for long-form content
where the length constraint adds friction without semantic value.

```cobol
01 BODY-TEXT PIC X AUTOLEN VALUE "...any length string...".
```

The compiler sizes the field to fit, no truncation warning, no RCL-002. Designed for
body copy, article text, and any field where the author cannot predict the exact
character count at declaration time.

---

### `--draft` Mode

**Goal:** Compile with missing or empty DATA DIVISION fields using placeholder content.
Allows authoring the structure before filling in the values.

```sh
recall compile page.rcl --draft
# Fields with no VALUE render as "[FIELD-NAME]" placeholders
# Structural errors still abort. Missing values do not.
```

**Why it matters:** Removes the blank-VALUE friction from early authoring. The
author can scaffold the page structure, see how it renders, and fill in values
incrementally.

---

### `recall summarize` — Artifact Intelligence

**Goal:** A structured summary of a `.rcl` source (or compiled `.html`) across
eight lenses. Not a prose description — a machine-readable + human-readable report
that answers "what is this artifact and who is responsible for it?" in one command.

```sh
recall summarize page.rcl            # full eight-lens report
recall summarize page.html           # extract embedded source, then summarize
recall summarize page.rcl --audit              # authorship + change lenses only
recall summarize page.rcl --lens data          # single lens
recall summarize page.rcl --format json        # machine-readable, AI-consumable
```

**The eight lenses:**

| Lens | What it reports |
|---|---|
| **Structural** | Division count, section count, field count, element count |
| **Intent** | PAGE-TITLE, DESCRIPTION, section IDs, WITH INTENT clause count + text |
| **Data** | Field names, PIC types, VALUE sizes, LOAD FROM sources, group cardinality |
| **Authorship** | CREATED-BY kind, CREATED-DATE, CHANGE-LOG entry count, breakdown by author kind (Human / AI compositor / AI agent), last human touch, last AI touch |
| **Change** | CHANGE-LOG timeline, most recent entry, total changes, first/last dates |
| **Diagnostic** | Error count, warning count, coverage_pct, truncation count |
| **Dependency** | COPY FROM paths, LOAD FROM files, LOAD PLUGIN packages |
| **Output** | Element types used, layout patterns (CENTERED / STACK / GRID / SIDEBAR), estimated output size |

**`--audit` flag:**

Collapses the Authorship and Change lenses into a human-readable provenance brief.
The focused answer to "who is responsible for this artifact?":

```
RECALL SUMMARY  page.rcl  --audit
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Created by:    Human  (2026-04-11)
Last touched:  Human  (2026-04-11)
Changes:       1  (1 Human, 0 AI compositor, 0 AI agent)
Coverage:      94%
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2026-04-11  Hero copy updated. Human. "Sharpened for launch."
```

**Why it extends the philosophy:** Every RECALL artifact already carries its own
source, provenance, and authorship in structured form. `recall summarize` makes
that embedded intelligence queryable. The artifact answers for itself.

This matters most in three contexts:

1. **AI agents scanning compiled output** — before modifying or re-composing a page,
   an agent can read a structured summary of who wrote what, when, and with what intent.
   No need to re-parse the full source.

2. **Pipeline auditing** — `recall summarize --format json` produces the same shape
   as brief JSON and Pipeline Manifest output. Feeds directly into orchestrator loops
   and case study indexes without extra transformation.

3. **Long-lived documents** — when a page has been touched by both Human and AI
   compositor over months, the Authorship and Change lenses produce a timestamped
   record of the human-AI collaboration history that lives in the artifact, not in git.

**Relationship to `recall diff` and `recall audit`:**

| Command | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `recall audit` | Who changed what, in what order |
| `recall diff` | What structurally changed between two versions |
| `recall summarize` | What this artifact is and who is responsible for it, right now |

They compose: `recall diff HEAD~1 HEAD page.rcl --suggest-audit` produces a
CHANGE-LOG entry; `recall summarize` reads the CHANGE-LOG and reports it as
structured provenance.

**`--audit` is a lens filter, not a separate command.** The full lens set is
accessible from one command: `recall summarize`. `recall audit` retains its
existing job — print the raw CHANGE-LOG — and stays focused.

**Note:** The concept behind `recall summarize` is documented in depth in
`docs/ARTIFACT-INTELLIGENCE.md` — the broader thesis that compiled artifacts
should be self-describing and machine-queryable without a separate metadata layer.
